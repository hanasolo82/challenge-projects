### Project Goals

### 01 Credit-Card-Checker.
==========================
 Context: The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. In this project, you have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but you’ll be optimizing the verification process using your knowledge of functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, you can spend the rest of your time relaxing!

### 02 Mysterious Organism.
==========================
 Context: You’re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.

As you progress through the steps, use the terminal and console.log() statements to check the output of your loops and functions.

### 03 Random Proverb Generator.
===============================

Js code project that takes parts of sayings and mixes them into a new meaningless one.
It will have css and html parts for local viewing or maybe I'll post it on gitpages. We'll see 

### 04 Rooster Regulation.
=========================

An experimental rooster object has been developed without any tests! It’s up to you to write them.

By the end of this project you will have a fast, complete, reliable, isolated, maintainable, and expressive test suite: it will provide confidence that the rooster is functioning correctly and it will act as a form of documentation for other developers.
